# Data-structures-in-C
Data structures implemented in C: Linked List, Binary Tree, Hashtable

The folder "Data structures" contains implementation of Linked List, Binary Tree and Hashtable.

LinkedList folder:
Inside of c201 is a Sinly-Linked List, inside of c203 is a Queue, inside of c206 is a Doubly-Linked List.
Every algorightm can be tested by using Makefile, just use command 'make run'. .c files will be compiled and run, after that output data will be compared to test data and console prints if the data are identical or not. If they are identical then program performs right.

BinaryTree and Hashtable folder:
bree folder contains iterable and recursive Binary Trees. Folders iter and rec contains Makefile's, use command 'make' it will compile files that can be run using './test', prints binary trees with test data.
hashtable works the same way, use 'makefile', './test'.
